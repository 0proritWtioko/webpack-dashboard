## [3.0.0] - 2019-02-14

### Features

- Migrated from using `blessed` to [`neo-blessed`](https://github.com/embark-framework/neo-blessed) as the underlying terminal renderer. `neo-blessed` is a maintained fork of `blessed` and brings in some nice fixes for us. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/270
- Added Prettier to the codebase ðŸŽ‰ Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/270

### Docs

- Added a warning about deprecation of Node 6 support. Included in: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard/pull/270

### Migration Instructions

With this release we are dropping support for Node 6 altogether. `neo-blessed` requires Node [>= 8.0.0](https://github.com/embark-framework/neo-blessed/blob/master/package.json#L38), meaning all users of the dashboard will need to run it using Node 8 or above. Previous versions of `webpack-dashboard` are still compatible with Node 6.
